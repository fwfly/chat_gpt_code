In PostgreSQL BDR (Bi-Directional Replication), the bdr.bdr_nodes table contains information about the various nodes participating in the replication cluster. The node_status column indicates the current status of each node. Some of the key possible statuses for a node include:

r - Ready: The node is active and fully part of the cluster.
i - Initializing: The node is in the process of joining the cluster.
c - Catching up: The node is catching up with data replication from other nodes.
d - Disconnected: The node is currently not connected to the cluster.
f - Failed: The node has encountered a failure or is unable to continue operations.
These statuses allow the cluster to manage synchronization, connection issues, and other node-specific conditions, ensuring proper multi-master replication and conflict resolution.
